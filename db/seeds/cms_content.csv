about,history-text,Be sure to use <br> for paragraph breaks,"Al’s Formal Wear began with one tuxedo store, opened by Al Sankary in the Dallas area in 1952. A few years later, Sankary's brother-in-law Alan 'Al' Gaylor, along with wife Lillian, opened the first Houston store in the downtown area, officially making Al's Formal Wear a family business. With the two Als working together, they were destined for greatness. As the years went by, the business continued to grow, and they successfully outfitted customers through decades of fashion trends.

Al's Formal Wear currently has multiple stores located in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Colorado. Al's wholesale division, Ascot Formal Wear, supplies formalwear shops across the United States with tuxedos.

With Al Gaylor’s son, Stuart, now at the helm, Al’s Formal Wear has continued to grow, opening more stores in new markets, with many more to come. While Al Gaylor passed in April 2008, we hope to make him proud by continuing to offer our customers the best formal wear and customer service.",text,

First, check out the exclusive Michael Kors tuxedo, a jacket with a notch lapel, two buttons and side vents with flat front pants. Complement it with a matching vest if you like!

Or choose the new Allure by Jean Yves in Slate Blue. No satin lapel on this hot number. The jacket has self-piping trim, two buttons, flap pockets and side vents. You'll be the height of sophistication with the matching flat front pants and matching vest. It's not quite gray and it's not quite blue – it's an awesome blend of both.

If your date has her heart set on a classic style, check out Doni Barassi's Black Label. A single-button coat has a satin trimmed shawl lapel and no vents. It is irresistibly sexy with skinny flat front pants and a skinny black tie.

contact,prom-faq-text-5,,"The hard part is deciding what to wear, where to eat and what kind of flowers to purchase. Everything else should be a piece of cake! In order to be a perfect gentleman, make a great first impression on her parents and show her an unforgettable evening, follow these tips:

Pay attention to the tiniest details. Those dark pants and those shiny black shoes call for black socks, not the white gym socks you always wear. Smell nice, but don't bathe in cologne. You've paid attention to your hair, but make sure your eyebrows are under control and that you didn't miss a spot while shaving. And last but not least – check those teeth and pop a breath mint!

Make a good first impression and start the evening on a good note. Pick up your date in person and on time – ring the doorbell, exchange pleasantries, compliment her on how beautiful she looks, and tolerate the photo op with a smile and great attitude – she will appreciate that and so will her parents!

Dinner etiquette. It's simple: If the table is already set, begin with the utensils that are placed outside and work your way in, toward your plate, with each course. Make the OK sign with both your hands. Your left hand forms a ""b"" – that's where your bread plate is. Your right hand forms a ""d"" – that's where your drink should be placed. B for bread, D for drink! No elbows on the table, never divorce the salt and pepper, place your napkin in your lap and remember to reward your server with a good tip. 20% of the total bill is a good rule of thumb.

At-prom behavior. Your date is the most important person in the room. Be friendly with your bros but don't ignore your date.",text,
